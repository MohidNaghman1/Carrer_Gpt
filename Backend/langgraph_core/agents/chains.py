    ## üß† Expert Resume Analysis

    ### üìä Resume Scorecard
    * **Clarity & Readability:** (Rate: Excellent / Good / Needs Improvement)
    * **Impact & Metrics:** (Rate: Excellent / Good / Needs Improvement)
    * **Technical Depth:** (Rate: Excellent / Good / Needs Improvement)
    * **ATS Optimization:** (Rate: Excellent / Good / Needs Improvement)

    ### ‚úÖ Major Strengths
    * **Strength 1:** (e.g., "The Projects section shows ownership from data preprocessing to model evaluation, a trait top employers value.")
    * **Strength 2:** (e.g., "Use of modern tools like LangChain and FAISS reflects alignment with current AI workflows.")
    * **Strength 3:** (Add if applicable)

    ### üö® Critical Issues to Address
    * **Issue 1:** (e.g., "Missing quantifiable metrics in 70% of bullet points")
    * **Issue 2:** (e.g., "Generic job descriptions that don't highlight unique contributions")
    * **Priority Level:** High/Medium/Low for each issue

    ### üéØ High-Impact Suggestions

    * **1. Add Quantifiable Impact**
    * **Issue:** (e.g., "Several project bullet points are descriptive but lack measurable outcomes.")
    * **Why it Matters:** Recruiters are drawn to numbers. Metrics instantly demonstrate value and scale.
    * **Before:** "Built a recommendation system for e-commerce."
    * **After:** "Built a recommendation system that improved product click-through rate by **22%** across 1M+ users using collaborative filtering."

    * **2. Use the XYZ Formula for Bullet Points**
    * **Issue:** (e.g., "Some statements focus on tasks instead of accomplishments.")
    * **Why it Matters:** The XYZ formula (Accomplished **[X]**, measured by **[Y]**, by doing **[Z]**) creates strong, impact-driven bullets.
    * **Before:** "Worked on preprocessing large datasets."
    * **After:** "Reduced ETL time by **40%** (Y) by automating preprocessing for a **20GB dataset** (X) using PySpark (Z)."

    * **3. Strengthen Technical Keywords for ATS**
    * **Issue:** (e.g., "Missing industry-standard keywords that ATS systems scan for.")
    * **Why it Matters:** 75% of resumes are filtered by ATS before human review. Strategic keyword placement is crucial.
    * **Recommendation:** Naturally integrate keywords like "machine learning," "data pipeline," "API development" based on target roles.

    * **4. Optimize Section Structure**
    * **Issue:** (e.g., "Current format may not pass the 6-second recruiter scan test.")
    * **Why it Matters:** Recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on initial resume screening.
    * **Recommendation:** Use clear section headers, consistent formatting, and strategic white space.

    ### üîß Specific Rewrite Examples
    (Provide 2-3 concrete before/after examples from the actual resume content)

    ### üìà Resume Enhancement Checklist
    - [ ] Every bullet point includes quantifiable results
    - [ ] Technical skills are prominently displayed
    - [ ] Action verbs start each accomplishment
    - [ ] Industry keywords are naturally integrated
    - [ ] Contact information is complete and professional
    - [ ] Format is ATS-friendly (no tables, complex formatting)

    ### ‚úçÔ∏è Final Recruiter Verdict
    **Overall Assessment:** (Strong/Good/Needs Work)
    
    **Key Message:** You have solid technical foundations. With these targeted improvements focusing on quantifiable impact and strategic keyword optimization, your resume will stand out in competitive applicant pools. The changes I've suggested will help you pass both ATS filters and the critical 6-second human review phase.

    **Next Steps:** Implement the high-impact suggestions first, then work through the enhancement checklist to ensure consistency across all sections.
